Version 2.02

Using the KYC3 API

# Introduction

With the KYC3 API it is possible to automate much of the first line manual risk assessment work currently performed by KYC/CDD personnel.  The API provides several functions that when used properly and together can return detailed risk information regarding an individual, an organization or a location.  These results can be used to assess risk, automate onboarding and screening functions, reduce false positives and escalate risky cases for final assessment. Moreover, the API consists of functions to extract identity data from international travel documents containing a machine readable zone (MRZ) and face recognition functions to compare live selfies or small videos to the facial picture on official documents.

The API consists of several functions that work independently or can be tied into a full risk assessment process.  Calls are made via the RESTful interface and returns are in JSON format.  All transactions are handled over HTTPS.  HTTP is not supported.  

With the KYC3 API one can:

* Extract structured information from identity documents containing a MRZ (name, date of birth, sex, nationality, document number, expiration date)

* Extract the facial image from identity documents

* Compare the facial image from an identity document to a selfie or short video

* Verify that a short video is live

* Verify two factor spoken text in a live video

* Compare identity information against PEP (politically exposed persons) and Sanction lists

* Retrieve media articles based on identity information

* Retrieve company information based on identity information (person or company)

* Retrieve country risk scores for use in risk calculations

* Calculate a general risk score for an identified individual

# Authentication

We support two ways of user authentication:

1. Before sending requests to the API the user has to login with his regular KYC3.com credentials.Then, he can use the retrieved authentication token in each request header "X-Auth-Token: <token>"

2. The user can send the API key as header with each request"X-Api-Key: <api_key>"

# API Function Overview

**/auth (POST): **This function is used to start an authenticated session and retrieves an auth-token.

**/logout (GET)**: This function is used to cancel an issued auth-token.

**/nameCheck (GET): **This function provides a quick and simple way to screen the name of an individual or company against all KYC3 sanctions and PEP (NOTE:  Politically Exposed Persons) lists.  The call accepts the search string, a full or partial set of name tokens, and returns a JSON structure containing the various sanction lists with hit counts.

**/entityDetails/sanction & /entityDetails/pep (GET): **These functions provide detailed sanction and PEP list information from the KYC3 intelligence database.  The call accepts the name search string and, when there is a name match on the list, this function will return the detailed entries that match.  All details provided by the relevant list are included, such as birthdate, nationality, residence location, known aliases and the nature of the sanction in question.

**/country/riskLookup (GET):** This function is used to retrieve country risk metrics for any given country code (ISO 3166 2 letter).  A general risk, plus specific corruption and AML risk metrics are provided.

**/entities/search (GET):** This function is used to search the KYC3 intelligence database for entities and returns a qualified set of entities matching the query.  This is the first step in accessing the KYC3 intelligence graph database as the resolved Entity ID is the required key to get additional information with other functions.

**/entities/related (GET):** This function is used to find the entities that are related to a specific entity.  The function returns a set of related entities (people, organizations and locations) known to KYC3.  This can be used to cross check relationships between people, organizations and locations.

**/media/byEntityId (GET): **This function is used to get the media, by topic, for any entity *by ID*.  The result set includes the main topics in which the entity is mentioned, the exposure in each topic and the top 25 media articles about the entity for each topic.

**/media/byEntityName (GET): **This function is used to get the media, by topic, for any entity *by Name, which may include multiple EntityIDs*, e.g. several "Steve Jobs" will each have their own EntityID.  The result set includes the main topics in which the entity is mentioned, the exposure in each topic and the top 25 media articles about the entity for each topic.

**/news/byEntityId (GET): **This function is used to retrieve the most recent media articles mentioning an entity, irrespective of the topic.  The result set includes a list of recent media articles containing references to the entity and, using the offset parameter, can be paginated to provide a "news browsing" UX.

**/media/byTopic (GET):** This function is used to retrieve the most recent media articles on a specific topic, irrespective of the entities mentioned therein.  The result set includes a list of recent media articles scoring highly on the specified topic and, using the offset parameter, can be paginated to provide a "news browsing" UX.

**/idCheck (POST): **This function validates:

1. The provided live selfie is genuine, meaning not manipulated, shows a human face and analyzes that the picture is taken from a true face and not from a still picture.

2. The provided passport is genuine, meaning not manipulated, has a valid MRZ, and contains the picture of a human face.

3. PEP/Sanction entries for the given name.

Moreover, the function:

1. reads the information from MRZ

2. compares the passport picture with the provided live selfie and determines if the faces mach.

**/identityValidator: **This function provides:

1. The provided live selfie is genuine, meaning not manipulated, shows a human face and analyzes that the picture is taken from a true face and not from a still picture.

2. The provided passport is genuine, meaning not manipulated, has a valid MRZ, and contains the picture of a human face.

Moreover, the function:

3. reads the information from MRZ

4. compares the passport picture with the provided live selfie and determines if the faces mach.

**/riskEval/eval (GET): **This function provides a risk value based on detailed sanction list information from the KYC3 intelligence database.  The call accepts the name search string. If the risk value is above a given threshold this function will return the detailed entries that match.  All details provided by the relevant list are included, such as birthdate, nationality, residence location, known aliases and the nature of the sanction in question. Moreover, the function provides a country risk metrics for any given country code (ISO 3166 2 letter).  A general risk, plus specific corruption and AML risk metrics are provided.

**/mrzExtractor (POST)**: This function reads the Machine Readable Zone from international Passports or ID-Cards and returns these values. The function accepts a jpeg or png picture of the front page and optional of the back page of an identification document. For Passports, the MRZ is expected to be on the front page and for ID-Cards on the back page.

**/faceRecognizer (POST)**: Provided a set of five selfie photos and an international Passport or ID-Card this function

1. checks if there is liveliness within the five selfies

2. all six faces (selfies + face from document) match.

**/videoRecognizer (POST)**: Provided a video, a picture of a travel document along with a proposed text (list of 5-10 randomly selected words) this function

1. checks from five frames that are randomly extracted from the video for liveliness

2. checks if the face from the five frames and the face from the id document match

3. performs a speech to text recognition on the spoken words

4. comares the recognized words to the list of provided words.

# Example Usage

All functions are accessible at the root URL: 

https://api.kyc3.com/v2/

An example call of the nameCheck function would be:

https://api.kyc3.com/v2/nameCheck?search_query=Sepp%20Blatter

curl -H "X-Api-Key: <api_key>" https://api.kyc3.com/v2/nameCheck?search_query=Sepp%20Blatter

curl -H "X-Auth-Token: <auth_token>" https://api.kyc3.com/v2/nameCheck?search_query=Sepp%20Blatter

An example query is given as:

curl 'https://api.kyc3.com/v2/riskEval/eval?fisrtName=Viktor&lastNameBout&cob=1970-01-13&country=RU’

Date is always in the format: YYYY-mm-dd

Overall, Sanction and Pep score values have to be interpreted as:

* 0 → Green (ok)

* 1 → Yellow (warning)

* 2 → Red (reject)

The risk score is computed on the basis of the provided information and the retrieved results from Sanction, PEP and negative Media screening. The following steps are performed:

* Name matching is computed such that all partial hits in the request and in the lists for given names as well a as for last names will be treated as hits if there is at least one hit for given name and for last name.All following tests will only be performed if the names match.

    * Check for Sanction entries

    * Check for PEP entries

    * Compare Date of Birth and Nationality to the ones returned by the sanction list and PEP list results. These comparisons will produce a score based on the following table.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td>nationality</td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>

Date
Of
Birth</td>
    <td></td>
    <td>Not equal (0)</td>
    <td>Equal (1)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td>Equal</td>
    <td>Yellow (1)</td>
    <td>Red (2)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td>Switch month/day</td>
    <td>Yellow (1)</td>
    <td>Yellow (1)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td>Offset 1 ± 2 years</td>
    <td></td>
    <td>Yellow (1)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td>Offset 2 ± 6 month</td>
    <td>Yellow (1)</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td>Other</td>
    <td>Green (0)</td>
    <td>Green (0)</td>
  </tr>
</table>


* For the countryRisk:

amlRisk is based on Basel Institute for Governance, corruptionRisk is based on Transparency International and totalRisk is a hybrid based on the others plus UNODC and other sources.

Risk is a evaluated on a scale of 1 to 10 with 1 being the low risk and 10 being high risk.

Invalid or partial country codes will return an error.

Some countries may have no data – resulting in -1 return value.

* Media Risk Score

A Media Risk score will be computed by mention counts per topic and the sum of them under the risk profiles (AML or reputation risk).  These can be normalized as % of all mentions for the name and across topic total figures (all entity mentions for the subject).

The function takes 6 to 7 input files depending on the kind of authorization document. For a passport one passport picture is sufficient because the picture and the MRZ are on the front page of the document. For ID cards the client has to provide pictures of both sides because the picture is on the front page whereas the MRZ is on the back page. Pictures have to have minimal depth of 400dpi and should be around 400x600 pixels in size for the selfies and around 1200x800 pixels for the passport pictures.

This function does sequential checking on the provided information as follows:

1. Check if there is one! Human face in each provided live picture file.If one picture contains not exactly one human face the algorithm rejects the image.

2. Check if the provided pictures are genuine, meaning that they have not been altered or manipulated in the transit between the mobile application and the API.

3. Check provided live pictures for liveliness. This means to check for the change in some aspect ratios in special regions of a human face (eyes, mouth or chin).If there is no motion in the facial region or a linear motion of all significant regions, indicating a still picture, the algorithm breaks.

4. Perform face recognition algorithm on all provided live selfies plus the detected face from the passport picture. If one of the pictures does not match the algorithm breaks.

5. Check if one of the provided pictures contains a MRZ, perform OCR on this region, compare with the checksum and provide all extracted information.

## /mrzExtractor (POST)

Given a picture of a passport or two pictures of both sides of an id card, this function will return the MRZ information and a face recognition (match) result.

# Sources

Today, KYC3 processes a large amount of public data in order to provide the intelligence capability that we deliver.  In addition to over 55,000 news and reputable industry blog sites that are monitored in near real-time, we also process all the major sanctions lists published by FATF member governments, public PEP lists and our own proprietary PEP lists.  

In addition to these "traditional" risk management sources, KYC3 also monitors a number of commercial registries in order to obtain company director, shareholder and location information.  The API can be used to obtain this information as well and can be a valuable tool in determining the locations of business relationships, the associates and the mandates related to an individual or company in the overall risk based KYC approach.  At the time of writing, the registries that are monitored include: US (Edgar), UK (partial), France, Belgium, Netherlands (partial), Switzerland (partial), and Luxembourg.

It is also possible to add additional sources to the system based on your requirements.  Adding news sources (URLs) is done at no charge for most requests.  If you wish to ensure that specific news sites are covered, please provide us a list of the URLs and we will either include them directly in the monitored content or revert to you with any concerns that we may have.  

# Putting it all Together

The API provides a granular and customizable facility to integrate KYC3 intelligence capabilities into any risk assessment or screening process.  Our aim is not to standardize your processes, but rather to provide a tool set that can be leveraged in order to gain efficiencies and competitive advantages in your current and future business process.  

We also provide assistance and advice on the use of the KYC3 API and have experience in delivering our capability across several use cases, including *prospect identification and qualification* systems, *customer and supplier risk monitoring* systems, *reputation risk management *systems and, of course, *classic KYC screening and compliance* systems.  

In order to understand how the various API functions can be used in concert, the following flowchart shows an example of the basic workings of the API as it would be implemented in a client on-boarding risk assessment process:

# FAQs

1)	Do you provide fuzzy matching, e.g. Bin Laden vs. Bin Ludden?

No and this is by design.  We can do this very easily, but fuzzy hits will greatly increase the number of false positives.  We rather advocate making separate API calls so that you know which exact tokens cause the hit and can intelligently investigate.  With respect to false positives and other risks, getSanctionEntityDetails includes DOB and nationality matching in the results and getMediaForEntity can be used for extensive media exposure assessment by topic.

2)	Do you support any non-western character set languages? 

Yes, we are language agnostic and support extended char sets.  You can search for Chinese, Russian, Arabic and other names already.  If you would like specific content added to our system, please include this in your feedback.

3)	Do you provide a solution for ongoing screening? 

The API can be called in batch from your systems.  We can also provide custom solutions, such as SaaS based screeners or delivery of risk indexes via EDI to your systems.  Please contact us if you require a custom solution.

4)	What are the Sanction and PEP lists and how often are they updated?

The lists are per the JSON definition in the API spec.  All lists are updated daily.  News is near-real-time and is used for PEP and bad-guy identification, along with other public sources of PEP information.  Our PEP lists are proprietary.  There are approximately 4.2 million entities (people, organizations and addresses) tagged with sanction and PEP tags.

5)	By using your API, would you store any of our (client) screening-related data?

We do not store any of your data and we only log a minimum of information required for debugging.  We are engineered to minimize our risk of data breach and to keep your data confidential.  The best way for us to keep your data confidential is not to have it.  While we could offer a BPO screening solution and alert you on your customer and counter-party risk, this is not our architecture today.
